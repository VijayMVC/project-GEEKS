SPRING 2019
CS 298-01
TEAM GEEKS 
Bruno DeSilva, Cris Fitzgerald, Eliot Griffin, Kenneth Kozlowski

OBJECTIVE:
Continue work on the DASSL Gradebook product.

Both Kenneth and Cris worked on functional requirements 10 and 12 (manage grade tiers and manage scores respectively), 
and as such our team would like to avoid duplicating work when possible. Instead, we have elected to focus on functional 
requirement 8 (manage courses) and 11 (manage sections, along with potentially 13 (manage attendance), time permitting.
We intend to extend the web client, and will be using Node JS for this purpose. 

We intend to model our file structure after the current Gradebook implementation; I.E. 3 main folders: docs, src, and tests. 
Src will be divided into DB files and web app files, with the web app being divided into client side and server side code.
