# Project GEEKS (Gradebook Extension of Elements and Key Services)

This project is based on the DASSL Gradebook Product (found here: https://github.com/DASSL/Gradebook), and will be a continuation of the projects worked on by Cris Fitzgerald (found here: https://github.com/S4PPH1QU3/CS-305-NERDS) and Ken Kozlowski (found here: https://github.com/CS305-F18-TeamDOS/Gradebook)

## Objective

This is an extension of the current functionality of the Gradebook product, with the inclusion of previous work.
Specifically, the extension intends to focus on the management of courses and sections (functional requirements 8 and 11, found in the [GradebookRequirements.pdf](https://github.com/smacademic/project-GEEKS/blob/dev/docs/GradebookRequirements.pdf)).<!--This link will not work until the issue is pushed into the dev branch because it is an absolute link to the dev branches copy of this file.-->
The extension will also be integrating work previously done on grade tier and score management (functional requirements 10 and 12).

## File Structure

The files will be separated into three directories:  
* docs - for documentation  
* src - for all source code files
* tests - for all testing documentation used in verifying the functionality of the program

The src directory will be split into two sub-directories:  
* DB (database)  
* WebApp  
  * Client Files  
  * Server files
