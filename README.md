# Project GEEKS 

This project is based on the DASSL Gradebook Product (found here: https://github.com/DASSL/Gradebook) 

## Objective 

This is an extension of the current functionality of the Gradebook product, with the inclusion of previous work. 
Specifically, we intend to focus on the management of courses and sections (functional requirements 8 and 11, found in the pdf included with this file). 
We shall also be integrating work previously done on grade tier and score management (functional requirements 10 and 12). 

## File Structure 

The files shall be separated into two directories: docs, for documentation, and src, for code. The src directory shall be split into DB (database) and WebApp, and WebApp will be split into client and server side files.
