# Project GEEKS 

This project is based on the DASSL Gradebook Product (found here: https://github.com/DASSL/Gradebook) 

## Objective 

This is an extension of the current functionality of the Gradebook product, with the inclusion of previous work. 
Specifically, the extension intends to focus on the management of courses and sections (functional requirements 8 and 11, found in the GradebookRequirements.pdf included with this file). 
The extension will also be integrating work previously done on grade tier and score management (functional requirements 10 and 12). 

## File Structure 

The files will be separated into three directories:  
* docs - for documentation  
* src - for all source code files
* tests - for all testing documentation used in verifying the functionality of the program

The src directory will be split into two sub-directories:  
* DB (database)  
* WebApp  
  * Client Files  
  * Server files
