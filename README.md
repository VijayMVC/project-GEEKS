# Project GEEKS (Gradebook Extension of Elements and Key Services)

This project is based on the [DASSL version of Gradebook](https://github.com/DASSL/Gradebook), and will be a continuation of the projects worked on by [Cris Fitzgerald](https://github.com/S4PPH1QU3/CS-305-NERDS) and [Kenneth Kozlowski](https://github.com/CS305-F18-TeamDOS/Gradebook)  
<!--NOTE: The links to Cris and Ken's projects can now be accessed by clicking on the persons name. Also, by clicking on DASSL would bring the user to the version of Gradebook that DASSL has created.-->
---

## Objective

This is an extension of the current functionality of the Gradebook product, with the inclusion of previous work.
Specifically, the extension intends to focus on the management of courses and sections (functional requirements 8 and 11, found in the [GradebookRequirements.pdf](https://github.com/smacademic/project-GEEKS/blob/dev/docs/GradebookRequirements.pdf)).
The extension will also be integrating work previously done on grade tier and score management (functional requirements 10 and 12).

## File Structure

The files will be separated into three directories:  
* <u>docs</u> - for documentation  
* <u>src</u> - for all source code files
* <u>tests</u> - for all testing documentation used in verifying the functionality of the program
    * <u>SystemTesting</u> - This directory will be split into sub-directories for every release of Gradebook so that for any release that an end user decides to install, there would be documentation on verifying that the version of Gradebook is running as it is intended to be running.

The src directory will be split into two sub-directories:  
* DB (database)  
* WebApp  
  * Client Files  
  * Server files
