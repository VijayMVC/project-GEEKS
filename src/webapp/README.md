## Overview
This document outlines how to setup the Gradebook web application. There are
two parts to the web application: a client and server. The web server is an
intermediate layer between the DBMS and client. It serves the static client web page
to clients, and implements a REST API that the client web page uses to request Data
from the DBMS.  

The Gradebook web server is written in JavaScript using [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
The Gradebook web client is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using
[Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).
The current version of the web server has been tested with node.js 6.11.2 on Ubuntu 16.04.
The current version of the web client has been tested with Chrome, Edge, and Internet Explorer.

## Server Setup
In order for the web server to function, you must first install node.js and some
additional modules the Gradebook web server uses. Additionally, an instance of the Gradebook
database must be initialized and available for the server to connect to (see the README in `/src/db`).
1) Install node.js. The [node.js web page](https://nodejs.org/en/) details the installation
procedure for many different platforms. We recommend using a 6.x version of node.js.
Also, ensure that npm, node.js's module package manager is installed, as some installation
packages do not install it by default.
2) Install the required node.js modules. The Gradebook web server uses three node.js modules:
[Express](https://expressjs.com/), [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres), and
[The Stanford Javascript Crypto Library](http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/). All three can be installed automatically using npm.
   * Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the `Gradebook/src/webapp`
   folder (the same folder this README is in).
   * Execute the command `npm install`.This will automatically install all needed
   dependencies using the `package.json` file.

## Running the Server
To run the server, simply open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the
`/src/webapp` folder, and execute the command `npm start`. This will
start the Gradebook server. Note that this command may need to be executed with
elevated privileges, since the server listens on port 80 by default.

## Using the Client
Once the server has been started, open a web browser and navigate to `127.0.0.1`.
The login page for the Gradebook web client should be displayed. To use the application,
enter the email address of an instructor in the Gradebook database in the `Email` field,
and the password of the `gradebook` Postgres role. Next, click the arrow next to the `DB Info`
section and check the supplied values. These values will be used by the web server to connect
to the Gradebook database. Note that individual authentication for each
instructor is not yet implemented. Thus, the password provided should be for the
Postgres role supplied in the `DB Username` field.
