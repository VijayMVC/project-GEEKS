GradebookSystemTesting.md

This file will contain all of the system testing documentation for all of the functionality that was added
by Team GEEKS (CS298-01 Spring 2019). When this document is ready to be part of a release it will be
converted to a PDF format and the name of both the pdf and a copy of the markdown file will be named
like this: "GradebookSystemTesting_version_0.5.1.md" in a subdirectory of the current one with the name of
the directory being the same as the release tag name. The markdown file will be kept as a copy of the PDF
incase changes need to be made to that version of the document so that new versions do not have to have
items removed to make a new copy for an older release.

Team GEEKS:
Bruno DaSilva

### <u>Purpose of This Document</u>  
The purpose of this document is to give the ability to the End User, System Administrator, Server Administrator or anyone who installs the **Gradebook** software to be able to verify that the entire program is running as intended. This document will serve as a guide to verifying that all of the functionality of **Gradebook** is correctly working and that inputs that are *valid* return a positive responce from the program and that *invalid* input to the program will return an error to the end user and the server console.  
This document will also serve the purpose of guiding the person or team that is setting up **Gradebook** to be able to make the needed setup to personalize their installed version of **Gradebook** or to set up features that are not fully implemented yet that require hard coding certain fields.
